		<h1>Favorite State Website</h1>
		<h2><a href="https://www.vermont.gov/">Vermont</a></h2>
		<p>I like Vermont’s website the most because it was very easy to navigate and search. The information on the home page is well organized and easily readable. The pictures are appealing and the way the search bar is always available even when you scroll is also helpful. The services on the website are accessible through the navigation bar at the top and it’s easy to find what you are looking for on the website. The home page is not overly busy and the font choice is appropriate.</p>
		
		<h1>State #2</h1>
		<h2><a href="https://www.tn.gov/">Tennessee</a></h2>
		<p>Tennessee’s website is also very easy to navigate. The drop-down navigation bars at the top have links to more information regarding that topic, and as I was testing random links, some of them did not work. However, the rest of the website works, and is visually appealing. It looks new and updated and the colors and pictures look nice. The website also had a link to the home page that is always in the top right corner so you can easily access the main page. Tennessee’s website also included upcoming public meetings and links to all of their social media sites.</p>
		
		<h1>State #3</h1>
		<h2><a href="https://www.iowa.gov/">Iowa</a></h2>
		<p>Iowa’s website is visually appealing. It is well organized, colorful, and unique. The background does not move when you scroll which is a cool aspect. The headings on the site are very large and slightly overwhelming when you scroll. They included news and general facts about Iowa like the state flower and bird. I thought that was creative because I did not see that on any of the other sites. </p>
		
		<h1>State #4</h1>
		<h2><a href="https://alaska.gov/">Alaska</a></h2>
		<p>Alaska’s website is easy to navigate, and the search and navigation bar are obvious. The website does look slightly outdated, however. When you scroll there is another section of the website that provides a list of their services that is not in the navigation bar. It looked like a separate navigation which I thought was odd to not be included at the top. When I viewed the site on my phone it was the same view as on my laptop. This made all the links very small and hard to press. I had to zoom in on everything to press the correct link. There are very little pictures showcasing Alaska’s beauty, but the colors and font are appealing. </p>
		
		<h1>Least Favorite</h1>
		<h2><a href="https://www.ok.gov/">Oklahoma</a></h2>
		<p>I did not like Oklahoma’s website very much because it looks outdated and it is not easily navigable. The navigation bar is a small bar below the search, and it is not very clear. The colors and the background are not very exciting and there are no real pictures to illustrate the state. Overall the website was hard to navigate, and it was a little boring. </p>
