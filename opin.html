		<h1><a href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a></h1>
		<p>Etsy is a website where artists and sellers from all over the world come to sell their work and their collection of antique and vintage items. Some aspects that I like about the website is the user-friendly quality. In terms of searching for a product they have categories at the top of the page in a navigation bar that is easy to see. If you choose to directly search for something, the search has many different characteristics you can use to narrow down your search. This is something I appreciate, especially when I know exactly what I am looking for. Once you find an item you like, you can save it to customizable lists. When it comes to purchasing an item, the process is easy and secure. You can also easily contact sellers and request custom orders. </p>
<p>In terms of code, Etsy does use html5. When I checked on w3’s validator there were 129 errors and 64 warnings for Etsy’s code. Overall, I think the layout is done well. While searching, the website separates itself into columns to sort the products and the search bar which allows you to narrow your search. Visually it is appealing. There is only one main color beyond black and white, which is orange, and it is not overused. I feel that orange is not a common color used, and I think it shows the uniqueness of Etsy. The background color of the website is white, but the search bar is a light gray, which helps it stand out without being overwhelming.</p>
<p>The mobile app for Etsy looks and functions about the same as the desktop version. The app is clear and easy to navigate just like the website. The navigation bar is at the bottom of the screen and the search is at the top, both do not leave the screen as you scroll.</p>
		
	
		
		<h1><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a></h1>
		<p>Pinterest is a website where you can share and save creative ideas, pictures, stories, and pretty much any other thing you can imagine. The site allows a user to create their own boards to save items. Pinterest also uses the information from user’s saved boards and searches to suggest similar things that users may like. The navigation bar at the top is very easy to see and use. It is simple and only contains three items and three icons. This allows the user to access their profile and the home page very easily. Once you are on the home page and signed in, you can scroll through the suggested items from all of your boards, or you can scroll through items from only one board. I really like this aspect because if I want to sort through fun recipes, I can scroll through suggestions solely related to that rather than all the other information from my other boards. </p>
<p>When I checked Pinterest’s code on w3’s validator there were only two errors. The code is done well and simpler and more concise than Etsy’s. Pinterest is similar to Etsy in their color use. There is mostly shades of gray and black with one main color of red, and again the red is not used excessively. When you hover over the options in the navigation bar the background color changes from white to a light gray and it is a clean rounded design. Pinterest also has an option to send in your own request for new features. I think this is really unique, and I have seen the site improve over the years, which is potentially due to that feature. </p>
		<p>The mobile app for Pinterest is also very easy to navigate. One aspect I really like about this is that when you want to save something to one of your boards, you can simply hold down on the picture and it gives you the option to save it. This means you can save items to your boards a lot quicker.</p>
		
		
		<h1><a href="http://arngren.net/">Arngren</a></h1>
		<p>One of the worst websites I found is called Arngren.net. This site is overwhelming in so many ways. There are multiple colors and sizes of fonts and there is no organization, except the bar on the side which is poorly designed. There are hundreds of pictures of products on the home page and there is no clear link to access each product. The pictures are different sizes and are arranged in a collage format, some have borders, others don’t.  You also have to scroll from right to left to see everything, and once you scroll all the way to the right there is a large unnecessary white space. It looks as if there are selling outdoor products but there is no real sense of what the main focus is. Once you actually click on a product the design does not get any better. Links and pictures overlap each other and there is no clear way to purchase the product either. The entire time I spent on the sight was confusing and overwhelming. It is an awful site with no organization. </p>
<p>The code is very confusing, and they are using the table element for most items. However, they are only put one or two items in every table and then formatting each table with different colors and sizes of fonts and pictures. I checked the code on w3 and Arngren has close to one thousand errors on its site.</p>
