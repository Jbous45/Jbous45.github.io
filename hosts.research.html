<h1>Web Host Research</h1>
<h2>Web Host 1</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.hostgator.com" target="_new">Hostgator</a></h3>
<p>Cost – $3.95 for the first month – $6.95 monthly renewal for the most popular option</p>
<p>The other options are $2.75 or $5.95 a month for the limited and pro plans.</p>
<p>With the “Baby Plan”, which is $3.95 a month, you receive unlimited domains as well as unmetered bandwidth. 
All of the offered hosting plans include free SSL certification, transfers for domains and websites, templates, and an image library. 
HostGator's website builder is included with all the plans and has mobile ready templates.
HostGator also offers fifteen different top-level domains. They offer domain locking, renewal, and privacy protection. HostGator also provides a one hundred-dollar Google and Bing ad credit, and a forty-five day money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with the web hosting services. </p>
<h2>Web Host 2</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.fatcow.com/" target="_new">Fatcow</a></h3>
<p>Cost – $4.08 for the first month – $14.95 monthly renewal</p>
<p>FatCow includes a free domain name and offers over 350 different top-level domains.
 They also have tools to help you create and build your website, and they offer options to help you sell online if that is part of your business. 
 They include email so you can have a customized email based on your domain name. 
 They have marketing tools and advertising through search engines like Google and Bing. 
 They also provide one-hundred-dollar ad credits for both Google and Microsoft. </p>
<h2>Web Host 3</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.sitebuilder.com/" target="_new">Sitebuilder</a></h3>
<p>Cost – $4 for the first month – $12 monthly renewal for the most popular option</p>
<p>The other options are $4.80 or $7.20 a month</p>
<p>This plan includes free hosting and customizable layouts. The domain name price is included free for the first year.
The domain is then twenty-two dollars a year after the first year. 
Sitebuilder also offers articles and videos to help with the designing and editing of your website. 
Sitebuilder also offers e-commerce options for your site, website statistics, and ad-free websites. They include a website builder and templates to help with
the design of your website.</p>
<h2>Top Choice</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.hostgator.com" target="_new">Hostgator</a></h3>
<p>Overall, I think HostGator is the best option for businesses because it not only has the best price, but it also seems to have better offers as well. 
Both FatCow and HostGator have ad credits, but HostGator offers protection for your domain name and more resources to help build your site, and make it
mobile accessible
The site is also more user friendly and allows for customers to easily access information. </p>
